# QuoteGenerator - OpenClassrooms - Project 5
## Create a quotation generator

This repo contains OpenClassrooms Project 5 - Quote Generator. The goal of this project was to get familiar with JavaScript, and design an algorithm to meet a specification.

Requirements: 
* Generate random quotes when a function is called
* Each quote is a combination of 3 sentence fragments (beginning, middle, and end)
* Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
* Incorporate 2 types of quote generators (with different fragments)

Even though this project could've been done only in the consol, I chose to create a visual interface with custom buttons, radio buttons, illustrations and music.

Technologies:
* Functionality with **JavaScript**, interface created with **HTML** and **CSS**
